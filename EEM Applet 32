//In this example, what we can do is actually have an applet trigger another applet. This could ofcourse also be a TCL policy thats been registered.
So if we type show ip int brief, it will trigger this event and the action in this event will trigger a policy "1".//


event manager applet 1
 event none
 action 1.0 puts "Ahsan"
 
event manager applet 2
 event cli pattern "show ip interface brief" sync no skip no
 action 1.0 puts "Applet 2 ran"
 action 2.0 policy 1
