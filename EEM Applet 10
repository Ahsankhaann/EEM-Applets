//Another example applet of foreach loop usage, here the array of instance has numbers in it with the foreach logic so every one of them will be parsed. 
Now along with the usual parsing of every element of array and printing the value at each iteration on action 2.0, we are also including some actions alongside 
like in action 2.1, 2.2 and then on 2.3 we are displaying the output of the last action using $_cli_result command. So in this case, 2.3 is collecting the
output of 2.2 command which was the previous command to it and displaying it and finally action 3.0 is breaking out the foreach loop after all iterations are
done//


event manager applet iteration2
 event none
 action 1.0 foreach instance "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"
 action 2.0  puts "The current instance is $instance"
 action 2.1  cli command "enable"
 action 2.2  cli command "sh ip int brief"
 action 2.3  puts "$_cli_result"
 action 3.0 end
