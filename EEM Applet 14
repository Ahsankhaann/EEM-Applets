//Here we are matching on cli pattern wr.* mem'* or wr.* which are write memory or write, both are ways to copy running config to startup config. Now we 
mentioned sync yes means the execution of those commands depends on the _exit_status and by default _exit_default is non existent which by IOS is taken as
0. 0 means skip the execution of the command. Now we specified trigger condition of the event to 3 in a period of 60, so if the command is written 3 times in
60 seconds then the action will take place and it can be triggered either with event tag 1 or event tag 2. And the action is simply a syslog message printing
some output to user. Now the event condition is being matched everytime the user is saying write or write memory but it will only trigger the action when
its entered 3 times within 60 seconds, but the sync yes has taken away the ability of the command to work at all. Therefore, you need to be careful when
using cli pattern with sync yes. A quick fix of this would be to do sync no.//
