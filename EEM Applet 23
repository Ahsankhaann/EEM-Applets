//Simple applet that is showing how to create an event snmp-notification, the direction would be incoming if you're the SNMP server and outgoing if
you are the SNMP client thats how u will create an event based on generating or not generating snmp traps and notifications.//

 event snmp-notification oid 1 oid-val "1" op eq src-ip-address 192.168.1.2 dest-ip-address 192.168.1.1 direction incoming
 
 
 //Simple applet for SNMP-object event, this would be intercepting an SNMP trap and saying OKAY SO IM GONNA intercept this trap and then your choices ofcourse 
 would be with the sync, sync yes ofcourse u can set the exit_status to 1 and go ahead and send the original traffic through and do whatever actions we say
 here, our action could be to generate a completely different SNMP trap. So we have a choice to intercept original SNMP trap and modify it before changing it
 or just send the original trap. So this event will get trigger and then some actions will be performed that will tamper the SNMP trap parameters, those changes
 will be defined in actions.
 
 event manager applet SNMP_OBJ
 event snmp-object oid 1.9.9.9.9 type gauge sync yes
