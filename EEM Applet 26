//This applet is to portray different timers we have in EEM which are Absolute, Countdown, Watchdog, CRON. In this file, i have shown examples of Absolute,
Countdown and Watchdog timer, CRON timer will be covered in the next applet. So first example of Absolute timer, the time is defined in EPOCH format, and u can
find a epoch converter on the google and calculate the exact time you want your script to run and copy/paste that epoch timer in the event timer absolute time
and it will work breezely. The below epoch timer of 1673864220 is of 16 jan 2023 03:17:00 pm time, i tested this out and it worked perfectly, this particular
timer 'absolute' requires that you enter the entire timezone along with date in a epoch format to work. Also while you're at the epoch time converter, make sure 
your epoch format is set to local time if thats what you're referencing to as the format differs from GMT time but if your Router is set to GMT then you would
be fine with GMT format. The below epoch timer is in local time (Pakistan's).//

event manager applet 1
 event timer absolute time 1673864220
 action 1.0 puts "Absolute timer worked"
 
//This example is of countdown timer, it will trigger the event once in 20 seconds starting from the moment you exit out of applet after creating it and 
ofcourse u can set whatever time you want and it will countdown backward. For instance if u set countdown timer to 3600 seconds then it means the event
will get triggered after one hour when you exit out of that applet, and it will trigger only once.
 
event manager applet 2
 event timer countdown time 20
 action 1.0 puts "countdown timer worked"
 
//This example is of Watchdog timer, in my case i configured the watchdog time to 20 second, it means the event will trigger every 20 econds after i exit
out of the applet after creating it, if i set the time to 3600 seconds then it will trigger every hour. Thats the idea, it runs in a cycle and triggers the
event after the defined time has passed and will keep on triggering it after every cycle of that duration.
 
event manager applet 3
 event timer watchdog time 20
 action 1.0 puts "Watchdog timer worked"
