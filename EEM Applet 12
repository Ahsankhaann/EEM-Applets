#This is a simple applet, showing the usage of description and comments, desscription is just one per applet whereas comments can be done numerous times 
within an applet using action commands. Now the searching only works for the description in TCLscript therefore you can make the decription in applet as long
as you want but if you're using description in TCL, try to make it as brief as possible so that it can used in the searching.
