//This applet is showing the usage of if and else conditions. Some things to note:  If with else condition is useful, if condition with a goto comand is useful,
if alone doesn't do you any good in EEM. Action 100 is  printing a text, action 110 is taking input from the user and storing it in VALUE. Action 120 is
using an if condition which says if value of VALUE is equal to 100 then run the commands below to if otherwise go to else and run the commands below else.
And then action 180 is executed in either case i.e. after the execution of if or else commands//

 action 100 puts "Enter a value"
 action 110 gets VALUE
 action 120 if $VALUE eq "100"
 action 130  puts "The value is 100 ($VALUE)"
 action 140  decrement VALUE 10
 action 150  puts "The Modified value is $VALUE"
 action 160 else
 action 170  puts "The entered value is $VALUE"
