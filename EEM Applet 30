#Here we are triggering the event manually thats why the event is none, we can also debug these manual triggering of events by typing 
"debug event manager action cli" and you will see when you try to execute this script, it wouldn't work because copy run start brings forth a prompt and
we need to press Enter or carriage return to confirm it but our Event manager doen't do that. And it remains stucked in the script until default maxrun timer
of 20 second kicks in and terminate the script as we can see in the debug output. Now i included this here to show you the step by step working of the Event
Manager and how it works and how to tackle such issues. The improved version that recitifed this issue is below:

event manager applet 1
 event none
 action .5  cli command "en"
 action 1.0 cli command "copy run start" 






#Here, we included a new keyword pattern, which will look for a pattern "Destination" in the output after it writes the cli command "copy run start" and then
the action 1.5 will send a carriage return with its cli commmand empty quotes "", in other words this is the way you can send an enter key to the command line
using event manager. And this script will work perfectly.

event manager applet 1
 event none
 action .5  cli command "en"
 action 1.0 cli command "copy run start" pattern "Destination"
 action 1.5 cli command ""
