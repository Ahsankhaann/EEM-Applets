//This is a simple example, where we are tracking a main link and if it goes down, we will reboot the router.//

track 1 ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 reach
event man app LOSS_connectivity
event track 1 state down
action 1.0 puts " connectivity lost.. rebooting"
action 2.0 reload


//This can be made a bit more complex where we can also track multiple interfaces and reboot when many main link goes down, now if u are trying to just do this,
then we can do this very simple through some stuff we have already seen, if u wanted to added more stuff later and what im referring to if we go back to that 
application-specific event detector again, have it trigger a sub-system and a type and then u know that means that maybe some of your objects could a little 
complicated, in other words maybe we dont wanna say JUST IF THE INTERFACES GOES DOWN but IF THE interfaces goes down and this happens okay, im just trying to 
point out that u can get alot more complicated here with nesting and things like that if thats wat your interested in doing so, for what we wanna do is we just 
wanna do the same thing that we just did, we just wanna say that if all the interfaces goes down.//
