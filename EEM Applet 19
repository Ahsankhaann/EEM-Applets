#Simple eem script for interface counter transmit_rate_pps which is transmitted packets per second rate. You can trigger it in lab environment by pinging via 
that interface gig1 a 1000 packets in repeat. Ping to broadcast adddress of 255.255.255.255 wont trigger it because it has a timeout value of 2 between every 
ping and it sends 1 packet over 2 second, broadcast doesn't know that who is going to reply and sends ping to all addresses in its network and thats how it
works by invoking a 2 second timeout. The pings however only take like 2 to 4 milliseconds for each one of these broadcast destinations but the point is it 
still waited the time out of 2 seconds whereas Unicast packet is sent and when it gets a reply, it immediately sends another packet.
