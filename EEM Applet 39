#This applet will ensure that 192.168.175.2 is the statically defined default route until track 1 object is up where track 1 object is tracking gig3 so if 
gig 3 goes down, the floating default route via 192.168.2.2 will be operational. And the EEM script will display a message that internet is down and then the
backup floating route will take affect.
