//Here we have made a user-defined environment variable named "VAR" with a value of "Ahsan", then we made a EEM applet with an event 'None". The event none can
serve the purpose of executing this applet manually if we wish to. So in multiple event support, we can use one actual event and one event 'none' so we can
test our applet without causing the actual event to cause. Here we just displayed the value of the VAR as output using action puts command and '$' means that it
print the value of $VAR and not print the VAR itself. Then we set the value of VAR in another subsequent action 1.1 and then displayed it again in 1.2 to
display the changed value.//

#You can manually execute this applet by typing "event manager run test" command.

event manager environment VAR Ahsan
event manager applet test
 event none
 action 1.0 puts "$VAR"
 action 1.1 set VAR "changed to Clarent"
 action 1.2 puts "$VAR"
 exit
