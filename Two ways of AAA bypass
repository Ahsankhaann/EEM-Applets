//For bypassing authorization of TCLScript//
event manager policy <policy-name> authorization bypass

//For bypasing authorization of EEM Applet//
event manager applet <applet-name> authorization bypass


//Another method for bypasing authorization of EEM applet or TCLScript if you're doing tacacs+ command authorization and fallback local//
#Global config
AAA new-model
AAA authentication login def group tacacs+ local
AAA authentication login EEMScript none
AAA authorization exec EEMScript none 
AAA authorization command 0 EEMScript none
AAA authorization command 1 EEMScript none
AAA authorization command 15 EEMScript none

#Line vty 0 
login authentication EEMScript

Authorization commands 0 EEMScript
Authorization commands 1 EEMScript
Authorization commands 15 EEMScript
transport input none  
length 0  #set the terminal length to 0 because EEM doesn't need the terminal length that way EEM doesn't take up RAM on the router

//Although EEM is technically coming in through a VTY line it doesn't actually use any of the vty line protocol so thats why we said "transport input none" 
that prevents anybody else from accessing line vty 0 where unauthorized access and authentication is permitted. Now the other users who will try to telnet or
SSH will be directed to line vty 1 and the subsequent lines after it which do not have the broad access-control.//
