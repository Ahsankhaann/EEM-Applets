//Simple usage of foreach loop is done in the below EEM applet. Action 1.0 is using a foreach logic and using that logic on instance which has several elements
in it, its sort of like an array. Action 2.0 is printing the value of instance at each instance as it parses through the array. Action 3.0 is breaking out the
foreach loop which ofcourse will run after all iterations are done.//

event manager applet iteration
 event none
 action 1.0 foreach instance "red blue green yellow purple black white"
 action 2.0  puts "The current instance is $instance"
 action 3.0 end
