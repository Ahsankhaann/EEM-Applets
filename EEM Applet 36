#This is general debugging info for EEM, these below are the big ones which people use most of the time.
debug event manager action
debug event manager detector
debug event manager tcl

#This one is used if you're using RPC other than that its not gonna be used.
debug event manager xml

#This would be for things like getting registered and registers kicking off.

//one thing u can do is u can say no logging console just to have the debug and change the logging level that goes to buffer, thats a little trick u can do and 
just have your debug go to the buffer so u can say like "do show log" and see the buffers, see the buffered logs and see how much debugs is gonna dump to the 
screen before u turn it on and another thing that i always like to do is like before u type anything stupid is i would go into R2 and telnet to R1 prior to 
making any changes to R1 so if u by mistake turn on debug like "debug ip packet" on R1 which is a production router and it flood your console terminal and u 
lose access to it then i can always come back to R2 and undebug all using the telnet connection and it will solve the issue lol, so the idea is to kill it via 
a different session.//


//You can filter the output using an ACL, so if u just wanted to see OSPF, call it to an acl like lets say acl 100 is looking for ospf packets only then u can 
use the command below to achieve that.//
debug ip packet 100

#This is what most of people dont know, this is setting a conditional debug, debug int gig1 is setting the condition to only debug ip packet for gig1 and 
not for any other int and its gonna be less because its only relating to gig1. To turn conditional debug off, you type no debug int gig1 and this will
remove the condition. Now just to let u know, if u dont type "no debug int g1" and instead u type "show debugging" then it keeps the condition, that 
condition is still set, that can really get you later when you're trying to debug something completely different a week from now and u forget that debug 
condition was set u know and u will be like WHY AM I NOT SEEING ANY PACKETS ON THAT INTERFACE gig2 xd, so dont forget the condition gets set and to turn off is 
to say "no debug int gig1". While typing that no debug int gig1 command, it gives you a warning that maybe you are still debugging ip packet and you're removing
the condition now which means you're gonna be debugging on everything, are you sure you want to do this? So its a great caution but sometimse an overkill 
for lab environment where you're not really generating any huge traffic anyway.
