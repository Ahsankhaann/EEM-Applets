//Applet demontrating ussage of IOS Watchdog system event, tasksname is big here, we are using it to exactly match the processes of either CPU or Memory,
First example is of CPU proc, so you can find this IP Input when you type "show proc cpu | sec IP Input" or you can type "show proc cpu" and enter any process
name here to match on, then you specify the operation, in my case i did it greater than or equal to operator and the value to be 1 and period of 10 seconds, 
so its a value of 1 percent within say a period of 10 second. If this event gets triggered, we will get our message printed on cli.//

event manager applet IOS_WD_1
 event ioswdsysmon sub1 cpu-proc taskname "IP Input" op ge val 1 period 10
 action 1.0 puts "IP Input increasing"

//Another example of applet, this time we are watching memory-proc and again those processess which u can enter in the taskname of memory proc can be found
in "show proc memory", here we are using operator greater than and values of memory-proc is by default in kilobits, thou we can change it by setting 
ispercent to true which means that the value will now be taken as percent rather than kilobits, thou here we specified that ispercent is false means the value
is indeed in kilobits. Value is 100k and in a period of 10 seconds and when this event is triggered we will print a message defined in action 1.0.
Now in my lab, i saw this output printed various times while i was looking through various "show proc cpu" and "show proc memory" output. You can try to trigger
it that way too since the value is very unrealistic i.e. 100k and its triggered many times.//


event manager applet IOS_WD_2
 event ioswdsysmon sub1 mem-proc taskname "Net Input" op gt val 100 is-percent false period 10
 action 1.0 puts "Net Input increasing"
 
//Another example of applet, is 3rd example, where i used the taskname "IP Traceroute" which i found in "show proc memory", operator is set to GE and
val is 0, is-percent is true means the value is taken in percentage and perido of 60 second. So if value goes above or equal to 0% within a 60 period; it will
trigger the event and print the message. I was able to trigger this event by tracerouting to a directly connected neighbor. Thou its unrealistic value but
just for the sake of lab, i made it very low to trigger it.
 
event manager applet IOS_WD_3
 event ioswdsysmon sub1 mem-proc taskname "IP Traceroute" op ge val 0 is-percent true period 60
 action 1.0 puts "IP Traceroute memory usage increasing"
